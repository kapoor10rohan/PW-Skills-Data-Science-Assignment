    "Q1. A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used in classification analysis to visualize the performance of a machine learning model. It is a grid that shows the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions made by the model. These values are based on the actual class labels and the predicted class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Positive (TP): Model correctly predicted positive class.\n",
    "- True Negative (TN): Model correctly predicted negative class.\n",
    "- False Positive (FP): Model predicted positive class, but it was actually negative.\n",
    "- False Negative (FN): Model predicted negative class, but it was actually positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. A pair confusion matrix is a specialized form of confusion matrix used in multi-label classification tasks. In multi-label classification, each instance can be assigned multiple labels. A regular confusion matrix is not suitable for this scenario because it assumes each instance belongs to a single class. A pair confusion matrix accounts for the fact that an instance can have multiple true and predicted labels, providing a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), an extrinsic measure is an evaluation metric that assesses the performance of a language model based on its performance in a specific downstream task. For example, if you have a model trained for sentiment analysis, an extrinsic measure would be its accuracy or F1-score on a sentiment classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. An intrinsic measure in machine learning evaluates the performance of a model based on its predictions without considering any external tasks or applications. This means it assesses the model's performance on its own, often using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or accuracy. In contrast, an extrinsic measure evaluates a model's performance in the context of a specific task or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning is to provide a detailed breakdown of a model's performance on a classification task. It helps in identifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Positives (model correctly predicts positive class)\n",
    "- True Negatives (model correctly predicts negative class)\n",
    "- False Positives (model incorrectly predicts positive class)\n",
    "- False Negatives (model incorrectly predicts negative class)\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is crucial for understanding where a model excels and where it struggles, which can guide further improvements or adjustments to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Common intrinsic measures used to evaluate the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well-separated the clusters are.\n",
    "- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster.\n",
    "- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Assesses the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures provide quantitative assessments of clustering quality. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Limitations of using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric for classification tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imbalanced Datasets**: Accuracy can be misleading if classes are unevenly distributed.\n",
    "- **Misleading in Rare Events**: In scenarios with rare events, a high accuracy might mask the model's inability to detect the rare class.\n",
    "- **Not Accounting for Costs**: Different types of errors may have different costs, which accuracy does not take into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, additional metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and using domain-specific metrics should be considered. Additionally, techniques like resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and stratified sampling can help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets."
