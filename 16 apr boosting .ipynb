    "Boosting is an ensemble modeling technique that attempts to build a strong classifier from the number of weak classifiers. It is done by building a model by using weak models in series. Firstly, a model is built from the training data. Then the second model is built which tries to correct the errors present in the first model. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or the maximum number of models is added."

    "As an ensemble model, boosting comes with an easy-to-read and interpret algorithm, making its prediction interpretations easy to handle. The prediction capability is efficient through the use of its clone methods, such as bagging or random forest and decision trees. Boosting is a resilient method that curbs over-fitting easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "One disadvantage of boosting is that it is sensitive to outliers since every classifier is obliged to fix the errors in the predecessors. Thus, the method is too dependent on outliers. Another disadvantage is that the method is almost impossible to scale up. This is because every estimator bases its correctness on the previous predictors, thus making the procedure difficult to streamline."

As the number of estimators increases, the algorithm becomes more complex and can fit the training data better, which can reduce the bias. Additionally, since AdaBoost combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner, increasing the number of estimators can help to reduce variance and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, increasing the number of estimators can also increase the risk of overfitting the training data, which can reduce the model's ability to generalize to new data.
