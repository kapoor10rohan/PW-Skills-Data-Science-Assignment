    "A decision tree combines some decisions, whereas a random forest combines several decision trees. Thus, it is a long process, yet slow.\n",
    "Whereas, a decision tree is fast and operates easily on large data sets, especially the linear one. The random forest model needs rigorous training. When you are trying to put up a project, you might need more than one model. Thus, a large number of random forests, more the time. \n",
