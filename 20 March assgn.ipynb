    "Encoding is a technique of converting categorical variables into numerical values so that it could be easily fitted to a machine learning model.\n",
    "The performance of a machine learning model not only depends on the model and the hyperparameters but also on how we process and feed different types of variables to the model. Since most machine learning models only accept numerical variables, preprocessing the categorical variables becomes a necessary step. We need to convert these categorical variables to numbers such that the model is able to understand and extract valuable information."

    "One-Hot encoding technique is used when the features are nominal(do not have any order). In one hot encoding, for every categorical feature, a new variable is created. Categorical features are mapped with a binary variable containing either 0 or 1. Here, 0 represents the absence, and 1 represents the presence of that category.\n",
    "While encoding Nominal data, we have to consider the presence or absence of a feature. In such a case, no notion of order is present. For example, the city a person lives in. For the data, it is important to retain where a person lives. Here, We do not have any order or sequence. It is equal if a person lives in Delhi or Bangalore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where the number of categories in a categorical variable is very large. One-hot encoding creates a new binary feature for each category, which can result in a large number of features and may lead to overfitting, especially when the number of categories is much larger than the number of samples in the dataset.\n",

    "In contrast, nominal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, which can reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Nominal encoding is also preferred when there is no inherent order or rank among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example where nominal encoding may be preferred over one-hot encoding is in analyzing customer transaction data. Suppose we have a dataset of customer transactions for an e-commerce website, where the \"product category\" column can take one of several hundred values. If we were to use one-hot encoding to convert this categorical variable into numerical features, we would end up with several hundred binary features. This would result in a high-dimensional dataset and may lead to overfitting, especially if the number of samples is limited.\n",

    "On the other hand, using nominal encoding to convert the \"product category\" column into a numerical feature would reduce the dimensionality of the data and help in improving the performance of machine learning algorithms. Nominal encoding would also be preferred here since there is no inherent order or rank among the product categories."
