    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification. It is a probabilistic algorithm that assumes that the input variables are normally distributed, and it calculates the conditional probability of each class given the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-class classification, the algorithm calculates the conditional probability of each class given the input variables, and then selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class. This approach is known as the \"one-vs-all\" approach, where each class is treated as a binary classification problem, and the algorithm is run for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be modified to directly model the joint probability of all classes and input variables, which is known as the \"one-vs-one\" approach. In this approach, the algorithm calculates the joint probability of each class and input variables, and then selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.\n",
