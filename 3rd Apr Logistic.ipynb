    "F1 score is a machine learning evaluation metric that measures a model’s accuracy. It combines the precision and recall scores of a model.\n",
    "The accuracy metric computes how many times a model made a correct prediction across the entire dataset. This can be a reliable metric only if the dataset is class-balanced; that is, each class of the dataset has the same number of samples.\n",
    "Nevertheless, real-world datasets are heavily class-imbalanced, often making this metric unviable. For example, if a binary class dataset has 90 and 10 samples in class-1 and class-2, respectively, a model that only predicts “class-1,” regardless of the sample, will still be 90% accurate. Accuracy computes how many times a model made a correct prediction across the entire dataset. However, can this model be called a good predictor? This is where the F1 score comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures how many of the “positive” predictions made by the model were correct.\n",
    "Recall measures how many of the positive class samples present in the dataset were correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "Precision and recall offer a trade-off, i.e., one metric comes at the cost of another. More precision involves a harsher critic (classifier) that doubts even the actual positive samples from the dataset, thus reducing the recall score. On the other hand, more recall entails a lax critic that allows any sample that resembles a positive class to pass, which makes border-case negative samples classified as “positive,” thus reducing the precision. Ideally, we want to maximize both precision and recall metrics to obtain the perfect classifier."

But adopting a multi-cloud strategy is a complex undertaking.\n",

All the Intellectual Property an organization develops (the AI or ML models, analytics, the processes, the rules, the applications, and even the database) are locked in and dependent on the cloud provider’s infrastructure and products. This makes it extremely difficult to migrate your Intellectual Property from one service provider to another."

For example, an organization’s data scientists could easily scale their storage capacity up or down and optimize the computing power to run their ML algorithms using a particular cloud service provider. On the other hand, the application developers may choose to deploy their applications on another cloud that hosts their favorite database or which is better suited to handle a specific consumer activity workload.\n",

A multi-cloud strategy requires well-organized cross-functional teams to set up, monitor, optimize, and secure their AI applications across multiple clouds."
