Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. 
In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores.
SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). 

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.

DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc. All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.
a. CREATE: It is used to create a new table in the database.
 CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE); 
b. DROP: It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
 DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;  
c. ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
 ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));  
d. TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table
 TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE; 

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.


DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all form of changes in the database. The command of DML is not auto-committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.
a. INSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
 INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name) VALUES ("1", "Rohan");
b. UPDATE: This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
     UPDATE students    
    SET User_Name = 'Sonoo'    
    WHERE Student_Id = '3'  
c. DELETE: It is used to remove one or more row from a table.
     DELETE FROM javatpoint  
    WHERE Author="Sonoo";  


Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.

DQL is used to fetch the data from the database. 
a. SELECT: This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause. 
 SELECT emp_name  
 FROM employee  
 WHERE age > 20; 
 
Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.

Primary Key: A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. 
Foreign Key: 
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 


Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.

import mysql.connector
# import mysql.connector
#create user 'user'@'%' identified by 'password'
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password"
)
print(mydb)
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
mycursor.execute("SHOW DATABASES")
for x in mycursor:
  print(x)
 
A cursor is an object which helps to execute the query and fetch the records from the database. The cursor plays a very important role in executing the query. The execute () method helps us to execute the query and return records according to the query

Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.

    FROM and JOINs. The FROM clause, and subsequent JOINs are first executed to determine the total working set of data that is being queried.
    WHERE
    GROUP BY
    HAVING
    SELECT
    DISTINCT
    ORDER BY
    LIMIT / OFFSET
