    "Ridge regression is a better predictor than least squares regression when the predictor variables are more than the observations. The least squares method cannot tell the difference between more useful and less useful predictor variables and includes all the predictors while developing a model. This reduces the accuracy of the model, resulting in overfitting and redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above challenges are addressed by ridge regression. Ridge regression works with the advantage of not requiring unbiased estimators – rather, it adds bias to estimators to reduce the standard error. It adds bias enough to make the estimates a reliable representation of the population of data."

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection. In Ridge Regression, the L2 penalty term is added to the sum of squared errors, which helps to shrink the regression coefficients towards zero. This has the effect of reducing the magnitude of the coefficients for less important features. Features with small coefficients are likely to have less impact on the target variable and can be considered less important.\n",

    "In Ridge Regression, the coefficients should be interpreted in relation to the value of the tuning parameter (λ) used in the model. As the value of λ increases, the coefficients are shrunk more towards zero, reducing the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Therefore, a smaller coefficient in Ridge Regression does not necessarily mean that the independent variable has less impact on the dependent variable, but rather that its impact has been reduced due to the penalty term."
