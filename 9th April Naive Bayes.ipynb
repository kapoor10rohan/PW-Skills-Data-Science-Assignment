    "Bayes’ theorem describes the probability of occurrence of an event related to any condition. It is also considered for the case of conditional probability. Bayes theorem is also known as the formula for the probability of “causes”. For example: if we have to calculate the probability of taking a blue ball from the second bag out of three different bags of balls, where each bag contains three different colour balls viz. red, blue, black. In this case, the probability of occurrence of an event is calculated depending on other conditions is known as conditional probability\n",

    "The choice of which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for a given problem depends on the characteristics of the data and the assumptions that can be made about the distribution of the features. The three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers are Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. Gaussian Naive Bayes is used when the features are continuous and normally distributed, while Multinomial Naive Bayes is used when the features are discrete and have a multinomial distribution. Bernoulli Naive Bayes is used when the features are binary or Boolean. In practice, it is often useful to try all three types of classifiers and compare their performance on the specific problem."
